Question 2, was asking about classes. So, everything in the Node.py file because it defined the node class. 
In the WeightedGraph.py file also node class defines the weightedGraph class i.e. Line 3 to 39, basically.
The answer to question 3 is basically the main.py file. From line 1 to 26 to be more specific.
Question 4, asked about a method for finding the shortest distance/path. its in the WeightedGraph.py file. i.e., from line 41 to the end.
Question 5, the main.py file, Lines 28 to 31 are answering question 5 when they execute. So, those lines are basically covered by the screenshot you will take..
